id:

The id attribute is used to uniquely identify an HTML element within the document.

Each id attribute within an HTML document should have a unique value.
 If two or more elements have the same id, it's considered invalid HTML and can lead to unexpected behavior.

name:

The name attribute is commonly used with form elements like input fields, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
When a form is submitted, the data from elements with the same name attribute is typically collected as an array or group, which can be accessed using the name attribute's value.


<form>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female
</form>
